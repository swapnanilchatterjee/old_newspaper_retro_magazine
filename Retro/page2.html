                            My husband was polishing his medals ready for the 2011 Remembrance Sunday parade when I remarked that I bet he had more gongs than his dad, these days (my husband was a third generation career soldier – both his father and grandfather had served in the same Corps). “Oh, Dad doesn’t have that many medals,” he replied. “The joke in our family growing up was that Mum had seen more enemy action than he had.”How had I not known that my own mother-in-law saw active wartime service? I was intrigued, and inspired. Although she was sadly no longer ...</p>

                    <p>The war in Europe began on 23 August 1939, when the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a pact that created a partnership between them in dividing up Poland and the rest of Eastern Europe. Under the terms of this pact, the German Wehrmacht moved into western Poland on 1 September 1939, and the Soviet Red Army moved en masse into eastern Poland sixteen days later.  Great Britain, which had signed a bilateral defense treaty with Poland earlier that year, declared war against Germany as required by a secret protocol to the treaty. However, the protocol, as we now know, applied only to defense against Germany, not against any other country. Similarly, France, which also had signed a bilateral defense treaty with Poland that expressly applied only to Germany, declared war against Germany hours after Britain did. But neither the British nor the French government declared war against the Soviet Union. In Britain, where the public did not know about the secret provision to the British-Polish defense accord, the failure to declare war on the USSR was controversial at the time, seeming to give carte blanche to the Soviet Union for its conquests.</p>
